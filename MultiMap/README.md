I wanted to practice using generics, writing unit tests, and writing custom exceptions.

The MultiMap idea came from an C# interview question.

In the future I want to make the the class thread safe, then make some asynchronous tests.

I'm also going to try to make it Enumerable, by extending the IEnumerable interface.
